#Compilation

This project uses Compass and Coffee-script to make coding easier and safer to syntax mistakes.
See <http://compass-style.org> and <http://coffeescript.org> for installation instructions.

Compile your compass files automatically when a file is changed
```
compass watch
```

Compile your coffee-script files to javascript (in the javascripts/ folder)
```
coffee -c -w *.coffee
```

# Backbone.js

Backbone.js was used for structuring the project in a MVC way.  See http://backbonejs.org for more information and documentation.
